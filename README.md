# ChangeRefreshRate

This program changes the refresh rate of the primary display.

Inspired by Win11 dynamic refresh rate, but I prefer change it manually.  
Change to lower rate to save power, change to higher rate when playing game.

Usage:

ChangeRefreshRate.exe newRate

change refresh rate to 60
```
ChangeRefreshRate.exe 60
```
change refresh rate to 120 or higher when playing game
```
ChangeRefreshRate.exe 120
```
